Go to the page that holds the Pitchfork reviews that metacritic stores.

There are about 20 reviews a page.

From the first review, so the first box on the page, pull the relevant details in.

These will include the Metacritic score and the pitchfork score, and the links to the Metacritic review and the Pitchfork review.
From here we want to grab some information from the pitchfork review, using the link taken from the first review, and grab some more details.
These include “Artist name”, “Album Name”, Reviewer, Date Published, Genre, Designation (Best New Music).
Then we use the Meta critic link to grab other information a couple other pieces of relevant information, including the “user score”
After we’ve grabbed all of the information, we save those items as an entry in a database. That is one entry. We do this for every review on the page.
Then we go to the next page and pull all review from there.
